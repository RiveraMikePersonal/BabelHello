# BabelHello
I wrote this as a quick side project to experiment using python, django, and openai.  This was the first time I have ever done anything with python and django, so if something about structure or best practices is off that is why.
To use all you need to do is put an api key into the settings.py file.  They are free to get from openai if you sign up.
Then you can luanch the server and go to http://127.0.0.0:8000/hello
Type in your language and your sentence.
The request will flow through to openai and the page will return openai's response.  I can't vouch for openai's ability to translate languages.
